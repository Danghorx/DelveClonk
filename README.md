DelveClonk is a mod for [LegacyClonk](https://github.com/legacyclonk/LegacyClonk), that focuses on improving mining and underground exploration, while also adding some random cool stuff to the mix :)

for now, only the forge system is done, but needs some polish.

# How to edit the Mod?
Click *"Code"* and then *"Download Zip"*. Open the zip file anywhere, find the c4f folder and move it to the same folder as **LegacyClonk**

You can edit everything inside the c4f file in the Clonk Editor, which can be acquired by [Downloading Clonk Rage](http://www.clonk.de/cr.php) and pasting the editor exe file to the **LegacyClonk** folder.
(packing in Clonk Editor recommended)

C4Script documentation [Can be found here](https://crdocs.clonkspot.org/en/sdk/).

# How to edit the Models?
To edit the 3d models in the **Models** folder, you need [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and the [RenderClonk Addon](https://github.com/RoboClonk/RenderClonkAddon).
