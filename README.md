# DelveClonk
DelveClonk is a mod for [LegacyClonk](https://github.com/legacyclonk/LegacyClonk), that focuses on improving mining and underground exploration, while also adding some random cool stuff to the mix :)

for now, only the forge system is done, but needs some polish.

# How to edit
Click *"Code"* and then *"Download Zip"*. Open the zip file anywhere, inside should be a folder with the same name as the zip file. rename it to *"DelveClonk.c4f"* and put it in the same folder as **LegacyClonk**.

You can edit everything inside the c4f file in the Clonk Editor, which can be acquired by [Downloading Clonk Rage](http://www.clonk.de/cr.php) and pasting the editor exe file to the **LegacyClonk** folder.
